IF THE SONG HAS AN INTRO:

1. Add both the "LOOP" cue and "INTRO" cue to the same map
2. Next, set a delay for the "LOOP" track so that they line up and play sequentially. If you need assistance, listen to the "Fade-Out"
	track for guidance



IF THE SONG HAS A REVERB TAIL:

1. Add both the "LOOP" cue and "REVERB TAIL" cue to the same map
2. Set the "REVERB TAIL" cue to play ONLY after the "LOOP" cue has reached the end of its length
